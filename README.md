Budget Bud is a modern personal finance web application built using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and Supabase. It helps users manage their income using the 50/30/20 budgeting method. The app includes user authentication (login and registration), protected routing, and a clean, themed UI. It is deployed via Vercel, and any push to the main branch automatically updates the live site. To run locally, clone the repository, install dependencies with npm install, and create a .env file with your Supabase credentials (VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY). Then start the app using npm run dev. This project follows a simple Git workflow: pull before developing (git pull origin main), commit changes with a message (git commit -m "message"), and push (git push origin main). Environment secrets are ignored via .gitignore, and an .env.example file is included to help others get set up.
